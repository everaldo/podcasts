[Software Engineering Radio](http://www.se-radio.net/): one of the longest running programming podcasts. They deliberately try to have broad coverage of many different aspects and segments of the industry. Their hosts also do their homework before interviews.

[Code Newbie](https://www.codenewbie.org): as you'll learn from listening to SERadio, software is a big industry, and you're always a newbie to some part of it. This show is also a great resource for finding out new ways to help new developers enter the industry and thrive.

[Greater Than Code](http://www.greaterthancode.com): one of the few podcasts I'm aware of that focuses on the human, social, and emotional sides of software development. If you want to have a long-term sustainable software career, and help others do the same, this is a good one to pay attention to.

[Tech Done Right](http://www.techdoneright.io): a relatively new podcast from consultancy TableXI. The host, Noel Rappin, is a friend and one of the most thoughtful and fiercely non-dogmatic programmers I know. He's also easy to have a conversation with, a quality that makes for some great interviews.


[The Changelog](https://changelog.com): A podcast focused squarely on the Open-Source community. A good way to find out about new projects, as well as to get a better understanding of the challenges of open-source development, maintenance, and project management.

[Elixir Fountain](elixirfountain.com): A podcast that discusses the Elixir programming language. 

[Anticast](anticast.com.br): Brazilian podcast that discusses many different topics, from politics to TV series.

[Revisionist History](http://revisionisthistory.com): A storytelling style podcast created by Malcom Gladwell. "Every episode re-examines something from the past—an event, a person, an idea, even a song—and asks whether we got it right the first time. From Panoply Media. Because sometimes the past deserves a second chance."
